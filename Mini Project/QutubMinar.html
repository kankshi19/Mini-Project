<img src = "QutubMinar2.jpg">
<p>
Delhi's Qutub Minar is the tallest brick minaret in the world and one of the most popular monuments in India. Its rather dizzying height of 238 feet (72.5 meters) could be the size of a modern 20 story high-rise residential building! The monument's stark, soaring appearance evokes a sense of mystery, as do the extensive Hindu and Muslim ruins around it. The ruins reflect the violent end of Hindu reign in Delhi in the late 12th century and takeover by the Muslims. In recognition of its historical importance, the Qutub Minar complex was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. 

<h3>Location</h3>
