<h1> The Gateway of India </h1>
<img src = "Gateway_of_India.jpg">
<p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Bombay (Mumbai), India. 
It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.
The Gateway's arch has a height of 26 metres (85 feet) with its central dome being 15 metres (49 feet) in diameter.
The monument is built of yellow basalt and reinforced concrete.
The stones were sourced locally while the perforated screens were brought in from Gwalior.
The monument faces towards the Mumbai Harbour.
There are four turrets on the structure of the gateway, and there are steps constructed behind the arch of the Gateway which lead to the Arabian Sea.
The monument features intricate stone latticework (also known as the jali work).
The Gateway is amongst the prime tourist attractions in Mumbai.
The Gateway is a protected monument in Maharashtra under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
It is a regular gathering place for locals, street vendors, and photographers.
In 2012, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation moved the Elephanta Festival of Music and Dance from its original location at Elephanta Caves — where it had been celebrated for 23 years — to the Gateway, due to the increased capacity offered by the venue. 
The Gateway can host 2,000 to 2,500 people, whereas Elephanta Caves could host only 700 to 800.
